## Introduction
Data compression is a crucial aspect of information storage and transmission. This project focuses on implementing two popular compression algorithms: Huffman and LZM. These algorithms are widely used to reduce the size of textual and image data efficiently.

The repository includes not only the Python scripts for the algorithms but also standalone applications for users who prefer a graphical interface. This makes the compression and decompression processes straightforward and accessible to users of all experience levels.

## Features
- Huffman Compression/Decompression: Efficient text and image data compression using the Huffman algorithm.
- LZM Compression/Decompression: Advanced compression using the LZM algorithm for improved performance.
- User-friendly Applications: Standalone applications for both algorithms, making compression and decompression accessible to users.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
